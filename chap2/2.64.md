# Explnation of partial-tree

- A balanced tree, has same elements in it's left branch, and right branch.

- To achieve that effect in a list of elements, we first take a root node.

- Therefore, our remaining nodes are `(n - 1)`. 

- From these remaining nodes, we have to distribute half to left-branch, and other half to right-branch.

- Hence, elements in left and right are `floor[(n - 1)/2]`. 

- Knowing the size of the left branch, we can take the first l-size elements from the tree and build into the left branch, which can be a recursive partial-tree call. 

- This goes on, until we have a `n<-1` in a partial-tree call, which build a tree node like: `(entry=el, left='(), right='())`, where the left and right are made with a partial-tree call having `n<-0`. 

- As the left tree is completely built, the process to build right tree starts.

- Note that extra elements i.e cdr of result, will always be obtained from right-tree, left tree's will be remaining list elts.

- the right-tree starts from one element after(as it will be used for entry) the left-tree ended.
