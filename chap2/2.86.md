### To include numbers(integer, scheme-number, rational, real) as components of complex numbers

- operations performed on components of complex numbers, will need to define for the required number types.

- then, we can define those operations as an `apply-generic`


```
      (lambda (x) (tag (sin x)))) 
 (put 'cosine 'scheme-number 
      (lambda (x) (tag (cos x)))) 
  
 (put 'sine 'rational 
      (lambda (x) (tag (sin x)))) 
 (put 'cosine 'rational 
      (lambda (x) (tag (cos x)))) 
```

- also change constructors to use generic arithmetic operations
