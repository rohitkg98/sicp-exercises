### Transfer

```scheme
(define (transfer from-account to-account amount)
  ((from-account 'withdraw) amount)
  ((to-account 'deposit) amount))
```

- in this version, The withdrawls and deposits b/w concurrent processes can be interspersed, and that will cause a problem wrt to the inssuficient funds issue.

- suppose, account `a1` with $100, `a2` with $10 and `a3` with $10.

- if `transfer` $40 from `a1` to `a2` along with `transfer` $50 from `a2` to `a3`, then with the correct order we can have `a1` = 50, `a2` = 0, `a3` = 60.

- with incorrect and insufficient balance in `a2`, we will still deposit to `a3`, leading to `a1` = 50, `a2` = 50, `a3` = 60.

- if we consider that an account will never have insufficient balance, then we can conclude that this can run concurrently without problems.

- because at the end, we're withdrawing and depositing to account, which is serialized, order matters if they're dependent to get the balance.
