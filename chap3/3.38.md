### Commands

- initial balance = 100

```
Peter:	(set! balance (+ balance 10))
Paul:	(set! balance (- balance 20))
Mary:	(set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2)))
```

#### a. Sequential in ant order

- peter -> paul -> mary = paul -> peter -> mary = ((100 + 10) - 20) / 2 = `45`

- peter -> mary -> paul = ((100 + 10) / 2) - 20 = `35`

- paul -> mary -> peter = ((100 - 20) / 2) + 10 = `50`

- mary -> peter -> paul = mary -> paul -> peter = (100 / 2) + 10 - 20 = `40`

#### b. Interleaved

- In interleaved processes, the read value, and write value can or cannot differ for all the processes.

- they may even get completely overwritten.

- the possible combinations of the three steps for three processes end up being all possible permutations of the 9 steps with an exception.

- because, the 3 steps of of a transaction can only happen one after the other, we have to remove the otherwise possible options from our permutations.

- that results in `9!/(3! * 3! * 3!)`
