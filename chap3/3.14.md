- `mystery` performs the reverse operation, think of `set-cdr` as a `cons` being performed y as the `accumaltor`.

- before `mystery` is applied:
```
     +---+---+    +---+---+   +---+---+   +---+-+-+
v +->| + | +----->| + | +---->| + | +---->| + +-|-+
     +-|-+---+    +-|-+---+   +-|-+---+   +-|-+-+-+
       v            v           v           v 
       a            b           c           d
```

- after: `w` points to `v`
```
w
|
v    +---+---+    +---+---+   +---+---+   +---+-+-+
v +->| + | +----->| + | +---->| + | +---->| + +-|-+
     +-|-+---+    +-|-+---+   +-|-+---+   +-|-+-+-+
       v            v           v           v 
       d            c           b           a 
```
