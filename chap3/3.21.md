- the queue is represented as a pair of head and last pointer.

- the interpreter sees this as two lists, the head is from head to end, and the other is just the last element.

- that is why we see the last element twice.

- as for deletion, in deletion; we move the front-ptr one step ahead, so there will be no changes to rear-ptr.

- in case of single element queue, this means our queue is not nil.

- as out empty-queue? procedure check only the front-ptr, we can have the rear-ptr contain any value in case of empty-queue.

- so it contains the value of previous rear-ptr, which was the first-ptr for single element list, hence shows it twice.

- and it retains the value after deletion, because it doens't matter; the head is nil.
