- the `interleave` function, alternates the elements of the stream.

- to it, we are passing, a stream of all elements of `s2` paired with current element of `s1` and another pairs of the next elements of both `s2` and `s1`.

- the first few elements would be `((0 0) (1 1) (0 1) (2 2) (0 2) ..)`

- the odd elements in the stream would be `(0 X)`

- the even elements would be the stream obtained from `(pairs (1 2 ...) (1 2 ...))`

- and so on

- for a series `(n X)`, we can ge the index in `n`, which we can transform to `n - 1` until 0.

- so for a pair `(n X)`, if n and X are equal, the transform would be `upper_index = 2 ** n - 1`

- for a pair `(n X)`, if n and X are not equal(X will always be greater than n), the transform would be `upper_index = (2 ** n)*(X - n) + 2 ** (n - 1) - 1`
 fs
- the tranform to upper index would be `upper_index = lower_index * 2 - 1`

- applying this until series is 0, yields us the index in `0` series, and hence the numbers before it.

```scheme
(define (get-num-pairs n X)
    (cond ((= n X) (+ (expt 2 n) -1))
          (else (+ (* (expt 2 n) (- X n))
                   (expt 2 (- n 1))
                   -1))))
```

- `(0 0) _(1 1)_ (0 1) *(2 2)* (0 2) _(1 2)_ (0 3) -(3 3)- (0 4) _(1 3)_ (0 5) *(2 3)* (0 6) _(1 4)_ (0 7) -(4 4)- (0 8)`

- `(1 1) _ (1 2) _ (1 3) (1 4)`

- `(2 2) _ (2 3) _ (2 4)`

- `(3 3) _`
