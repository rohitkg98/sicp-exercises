```scheme
(define sum 0)
(define (accum x)
  (set! sum (+ x sum))
  sum)
(define seq (stream-map accum (stream-enumerate-interval 1 20)))
>>> sum = 1
(define y (stream-filter even? seq))
>>> sum = 6
(define z (stream-filter (lambda (x) (= (remainder x 5) 0))
                         seq))
>>> sum = 10
(stream-ref y 7)
>>> sum = 136
(display-stream z)
>>> sum = 210
```

- if we hadn't memoized `delay`, then our sum value would be greater, as we would add to sum everytime it is evaluated rather than once.
