### Memoize

```scheme
(define (memoize f)
  (let ((table (make-table)))
    (lambda (x)
      (let ((previously-computed-result (lookup x table)))
        (or previously-computed-result
            (let ((result (f x)))
              (insert! x result table)
              result))))))
```
- memo-fib
```scheme
(define memo-fib
  (memoize (lambda (n)
             (cond ((= n 0) 0)
                   ((= n 1) 1)
                   (else (+ (memo-fib (- n 1))
                            (memo-fib (- n 2))))))))
```

#### Environment diagram for memo-fib:

Global env:
  - memoize
  - memo-fib
  - E1(memoize):
    - table: empty
    - E2(frames of lambda in memo-fib and lambda in memoize in one frame):
      - n: 3
      - E3(inserts n=2 in table):
        - n: 2
        -E5(inserts n=1 in table):
          -n: 1
        -E6(inserts n=0 in table):
          -n: 0
      - E4(references n=1 from table):
        - n: 1

- Let's consider the branch model, and evaluation from left to right.
- The left most branch goes all the way to n = 0 and puts that result in table.
- as it returns, the results of previous calls also get insert to table.
- now the right branches don't compute results, they just return from lookup, hence no more recursive calls, only the left branch.
- This ends up being O(n).

- `(memoize fib)` would not work, because it calls `fib` once, and then `fib` calls itself recursively, without looking up in table.
