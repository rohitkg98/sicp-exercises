## Internal Definitions

#### The Procedure
```
(define (make-account balance)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
          ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
          (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT"
                       m))))
  dispatch)
```

### Frames evalualted:
- The expression:
```
(define acc (make-account 50))

((acc 'deposit) 40)

((acc 'withdraw) 60)
```

- `make-account` symbol in global frame, is bound to the procedure.

- when `make-account` is called; it will create a new frame E1 and then return a function `dispatch` which is in that frame

- after `make-account`

- Global env:
  - make-account
  - E1(make-account, acc):
    - balance: 50
    - E2(dispatch): `changes balance to 90`
      - m: 'deposit
      - E3:
        - amount: 40
    - E4(dispatch): `changes balance to 30`
      - m: 'withdraw
      - E5:
        - amount: 60

  - E6(make-account, acc2):
    - initial-amount: 100

- The local state is kept intact for `acc`, as it is in frame `E1`, `acc2` state is in frame E6.

- b/w `acc` and `acc2`, the global `make-account` definition with body is shared.
