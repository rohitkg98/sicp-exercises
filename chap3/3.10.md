## Let as Lambda eval

#### The Procedure
```
(define (make-withdraw initial-amount)
  (let ((balance initial-amount))
    (lambda (amount)
      (if (>= balance amount)
          (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
                 balance)
          "Insufficient funds"))))
```

- when we eval the let as lambda, the procedure turns into

```
(define (make-withdraw initial-amount)
  ((lambda (balance)
     (lambda (amount)
       (if (>= balance amount)
           (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
                  balance)
           "Insufficient funds")))
   initial-amount))
```

### Frames evalualted:
- The expression:
```
(define W1 (make-withdraw 100))

(W1 50)

(define W2 (make-withdraw 100))
```
- Global env:
  - make-withdraw
  - E1(make-withdraw):
    - initial-amount: 100
    - E2:
      - balance: 100
      - E3:
        - amount: 50
  - E4(make-withdraw):
    - initial-amount: 100
    - E5:
      - balance: 100

- there will be two frames created in a call to `make-withdraw`.
