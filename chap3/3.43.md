### Exchange

- $10, $20, and $30, if the values among these are exchanged n times, sequentially, then at the end we get them back in any order.

- because, `exchange` can only only take place b/w two accounts at one time.

- if we keep exchanging b/w any two accounts out of n, we are still left with the same n balances but might be in different accounts.

#### Serialized Account, Unserialized Exchange

- This will violate the above condition, for example:

- let there be `a1` with $10, `a2` $20, `a3` $30.

- consider `e1` which exchanges values b/w `a3` and `a2`, `e2` which exchanges values b/w `a3` and `a1`.

- `e1` accesses the values of `a3`(30) and `a2`(20); diff = 10
    -> `e2` accesses the values of `a3`(30) and `a1`(10); diff = 20
    -> `e1` withdraws $10 from `a3`; a3 = 20
    -> `e2` withdraws $20 from `a3`; a3 = 0
    -> `e1` deposits $10 to `a2`; a2 = $30
    -> `e2` deposits $20 to `a1`; a1 = $30

-> the above timing diagram leaves `a3` with zero balance, but the sum is still $60.

-> The sum will not always be preserved, when we consider the problem of insufficient funds in accounts.

#### Unserialied Account, Unserialized Exchange, sum violation without insuffiencient fund.

- in the above case, if `e1`'s withdrawl from `a3`, gets overwritten by `e2` we are left with 10$ in `a3` account.(assuming they both read $30)

- finally, we have $10, $30, $30 ,resulting in a sum of 70.
