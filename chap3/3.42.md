## Statically Serialized

- We are serializing a function once, and calling it multiple times.

- Now, depending upon the implementation of the serializer, if it allows concurrent execution of multiple calls of a serialized function, then it might cause concurrency issues.

- if it doesn't, then it is safe to do the change
