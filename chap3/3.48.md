### Deadlock Avoidance

- The method of number and acquiring starting from lowest can be labelled as a deadlock avoidance method.

- The works because the process of obtaining a resource is the same for each caller.

- The order of first and subsequent resources to be obtained will not be random, hence we can ensure that a process only obtains all required locks, if they can acquire the ones before it.

- For eg: with consider available resources labelled 1 to 10.

- let's say process a locks 2 and 5 to 7.

- now there is a process b, which requires 1, 2, 3, 6, 7.

- the only way a deadlock could have occured here was process a locked 5 or 6 or 7 first, and process b locked 2 first.

- but that scenario can never happen, because a process ensures it has sequentially acquired all resources it depends on.
