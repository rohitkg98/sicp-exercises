# Serialized Balance

- we can think of it as applying read locks

- so we're essentially debating whether reads can be concurrent to writes.

- The problem i see that could happen is, `balance` accesses and `withdraw` or `deposit` immediately change the value.

- This means, the `balance` shown is not updated, but as we are not using this unmodified value for any tasks, just for reading, it's fine.

- and, the above phenomenon can also occur in serialized one.

- Therefore, reads can execute concurrently, as long as the read value is not used to write back.

- hence, i don't agree with ben.
