## Before Serializing

- 1000000:	P1 executes before P2, or P2 executes before P1
- 10000:	P2 changes x from 10 to 1000 between the two times that P1 accesses the value of x during the evaluation of (* x x).
- 10000:	P2 accesses twice x, then P1 sets x to 100, then P2 accesses x and sets x.
- 100000:	P2 accesses x, then P1 sets x to 100, then P2 accesses x twice and sets x.
- 100:	P1 accesses x (twice), then P2 sets x to 1000, then P1 sets x.
- 1000:	P2 accesses x (twice), then P1 sets x to 100, then P2 sets x.

## After
- only 1000000, because order doesn't matter
