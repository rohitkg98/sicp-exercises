### Non Atomic Mutex

- let's have one `test-and-set!` as `t1` and another as `test-and-set!` as`t2`.

- `t1` accesses value of `cell`
  -> `t2` acceses value of `cell`
  -> `t1` acquires sets the value of cell and returns false.
  -> `t2` acquires sets the value of cell and returns false, hence both execute.
