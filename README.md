Solutions to exercises from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

### What is SICP?
- It is a textbook written by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, for MIT's Intro to CompSci course.
- It teaches fundamental principles of computer programming, including recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation.
- More about it can be read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs)
- The textbook is freely available, can be found [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

### Why am I reading and solving it?
- It teaches a way of reasoning about programs, from what I have read and solved so far, it has provided me a profound insight into ways that computer programs can be formed.
- Don't believe me? Read Peter Norvig's review aboout the book: https://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8
- It also teaches different paradigms of programming, and provides the foundation for them.
- So I'm reading it as an eventual build up to Benjamin Pierce's Types and Programming Languages.
